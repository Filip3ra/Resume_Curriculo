Hi, my name is Filipi Maciel, and I’m a software developer from Brazil.

Before i can acctualy start,

I hold a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Federal Institute, where I’ve been involved in several projects related to programming.

Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to build a solid foundation in software development through both professional experience and 
personal projects. Most recently, I worked at Sicoob, a major credit cooperative, similar to a bank, here in brazil, as a Data Analyst. 
There, I automated business reports using VBA, handled data with IBM Cognos Analytics, and created interactive dashboards using 
Power BI. This experience helped me develop strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, especially when it comes to transforming 
data into clear and actionable insights.

Earlier in my journey, I also worked as a Project Manager at UaiCode, a junior enterprise focused on software development. 
In this role, I managed full project lifecycles, from planning to delivery, coordinating tasks between developers, stakeholders, and QA teams. 
I applied Agile Scrum methodology, managed deadlines and risks, and ensured the team stayed aligned with the client’s goals. 
This experience strengthened my leadership, communication, and organizational skills — qualities that continue to support my growth as a 
developer today.

In terms of technical projects, I developed an Event Management System using C#, .NET, and Minimal API. 
This application includes login authentication and CRUD operations for managing events and staff. It was designed to 
streamline the organization of small to medium-sized events. I also created an Investment API using JavaScript and HTML, 
which simulates how long it would take to reach a financial goal based on monthly and annual investments.

Outside of development, I’ve also been actively involved in educational initiatives where I taught programming and robotics to 
children and teenagers.       These experiences not only deepened my technical knowledge, but also sharpened my communication and mentoring skills.

Right now, my professional focus is on backend development using C# and .NET. 

I’m passionate about building robust, 
efficient systems, and I’m constantly looking to improve my skills and contribute to meaningful projects. 

Thank you for watching, and I look forward to the chance to be part of your team.
